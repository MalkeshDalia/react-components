If needed, a panel could also have a header showing a title (to better understand what's inside it) or any component that should have effects on the entity the group refers to (e.g. CTA or filters):

## Default panel attributes
A panel could be `floated` or `docked`.

When `floated`, its sides don't touch any other component.
