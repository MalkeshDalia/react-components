          What is boutique hotel design, and why does it matter?
          There are fashion trends in hotel design just
          as there are in other areas. In the late eighties and
          through the nineties, that fashion was for clean, stark,
          minimalist design, particularly in city hotels. This was
          such a diversion from the traditional way.
