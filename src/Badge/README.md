A small UI that can be used standalone as a tag or label, or attached to other UI components as a notification or count

# Usage as Tag

A Badge can be used as a tag, to describe and categorize items:

<img width="189" alt="screen shot 2018-04-06 at 16 14 41" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2643520/38426053-dde5a91e-39b5-11e8-83e5-413f0077f50a.png">

Using a Badge is an hint for the user that there might be different categories other than the ones displayed at the current time.

# Usage as a counter

A Badge can be used as a counter, to show e.g. the total number of items a search has matched:

<img width="129" alt="screen shot 2018-04-06 at 16 25 57" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2643520/38426539-38052202-39b7-11e8-8caf-d830e156324a.png">

When attached to another UI element (typically an icon or a menu item), a Badge can be used as a notification counter, to show e.g. the number of unread messages in an inbox:

<img width="172" alt="screen shot 2018-04-06 at 16 14 50" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2643520/38426220-5f267bd4-39b6-11e8-8f6b-63f8e8fc69b6.png">

In this case, the counter Badge is typically only shown when the number is greater than 0, to draw user's attention.
